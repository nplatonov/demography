*License: MIT*

This is a simulator of polar bear lifespan based on certain demogrpaphical parameters.

'Randomize scenario' defines new set of demographical parameters.

it is used for occassional selection, which individual will survive, mate, *etc*.

On the current state of project,
the results cannot be used as an argument for certain polar bear population management.
