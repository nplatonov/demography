## General

### Polar bear facts at [bear.org](https://www.bear.org/website/bear-pages/polar-bear/22-/70-polar-bear-facts.html)

Females generally breed once every 3 years (Stirling 1990, p 81)

At 2 ½ years, lactation ceases and either the female separates from her cubs or an adult male frightens the cubs away as he begins to follow the female in hopes of mating.

Females usually breed for the first time when they are 4 years of age (Stirling 1990, p 89).

Litter Size: Two-thirds of all births result in twins.  Single cubs account for 20-30% of all births.  Triplets do occur but in most cases one of the cubs does not survive (Stirling 1990, p 88).


Longevity: The average age of a polar bear in the wild is 15 - 18 years. Females stop having cubs around the age of 20.  Some polar bears have been know to live as long as up to 32 years (Stirling and Guravich 1990, p 139-140).

### Polar bear at [BearTrust](https://beartrust.org/polar-bear)

Life expectancy in the wild can be as long as 30 years. In captivity, life expectancy can reach 40 years.

Females reach maturity at 4 to 6 years. Polar bears mate from late March to late May, and cubs are born between late November and early January. Litter size ranges from 1 to 3 cubs; two is most common. Cubs remain with their mothers until they are two-and-a-half years of age. (In western Hudson Bay , some females used to wean cubs at 1.5 years).

### Polar bears at [The National Wildlife Federation](https://www.nwf.org/polarbear/)

Polar bears in the wild can live to be 30 years of age, but this is rare. Most adults die before they reach 25 years.

#### Litter size ([link](http://wildpro.twycrosszoo.org/S/0MCarnivor/ursidae/ursus/Ursus_maritimus/07ursus_maritimuslifephys.htm#Litter))

> SUMMARY: Litter size is one to three cubs, very rarely four; two may be usual and is common in captivity. Reported average litter sizes in the wild range from 1.58 - 2.0. The largest, heaviest females, eight to 15 years old, produce the largest litters.

+ Average in the wild 1.58 - 1.87; in captivity commonly two. (D244)

+ There are geographical variations in average litter size. (D244)

+ One to four, average about two. (B147)

+ About two thirds of litters are of two cubs, next most common are litters of a single cub, while triplets are found usually in less than 5% of litters but in some populations up to 12% of litters are triplets. (B285.w4)

+ One to four, usually two. (B180.w4)

+ The largest, heaviest females, age eight to 15 years, produce the largest and heaviest litters; younger and older females are more likely to produce a single cub. (B285.w4)

+ Usually one to two; one to four reported. (B336.51.w51)

+ Usually two, may be one to three. (B144)

+ Mean litter size varies with area; usually it is about 1.6 - 1.8, but it may reach 2.0 in the lower Hudson Bay. (B406.37.w37)

+ A study in the Hudson Bay area, Canada, 1980-1985, found that litters of two cubs were predominant (nearly 70% of litters), with about 20% of litters having a single cub. Females with litters of three or (one case) four cubs were 16.3 years old (mean), older than the average age of 13.0 years for females with twins. (J46.214.w2, `r citep("Ramsay_1988")`)

+ Larger, heavier females tend to produce larger litters. A study of 27 females in the western Hudson Bay area, 1980-1992, found that five of the six females which were heaviest in autumn before denning produced triplets. (J46.234.w1, `r citep("Derocherand_1994")`)

+ In Svalbard, for counts over the period 1973 to 1983 in different areas, counts of females included one with four cubs-of-the-year (COY), three with three COY, 98 with two, and 27 with one, giving an average litter size of 2.27. The data might be biased by the observed triplets and litter of four cubs from Edgeoya and Barentsoya in 1983; triplets are rare and if the triplets and litter of four cubs are ignored, the data gives an average litter size of 1.78. However, a possible bias for some cubs not to be seen, if a cub is still in the den while its mother is outside and counted, was acknowledged also. It was suggested that the actual average probably was close to 2.0 at the time of den emergence. For females with yearlings, 13 were accompanied by one yearling and seven by two yearlings. (J40.49.w3, `r citep("Larsen_1985")`)

+ Litter size of polar bears varies between areas, but this is not correlated with latitude. Litter size may be affected by ecosystem productivity and population demography. Females in their mid teens, with heavier body weights, are more likely to produce large litters than are younger females of lower body weight: if harvesting affects population age structure, it is likely also to affect average litter size; density-dependent population regulation may also play a role, as the proportion of triplet litters may relate to population density relative to the carrying capacity of the area. Observed litter size varies depending on the date of sampling, due to mortality of cubs after they leave the maternity den; cub mortality varies between years. (J344.22.w3, `r citep("Derocher_1999")`)

#### Reproductivity cycle (time between litters) ([link](http://wildpro.twycrosszoo.org/S/0MCarnivor/ursidae/ursus/Ursus_maritimus/07ursus_maritimuslifephys.htm#Time))

> SUMMARY: Polar bears breed every two to four years, usually every three years. Previously, breeding often occurred every two years in the lower Hudson Bay area, but this has changed recently.

+ Mean time between litters 3.6 years (western Beaufort Sea data). (D244)

+ Range of two to four years, median and mode three years, for eight known reproductive cycles based on capture-recapture data. (D244)

+ Two to four years. (B147)

+ Three years. (B285.w4)

+ Two years. (B180.w4)

+ In most areas polar bears breed only every three years or at longer intervals; in the lower Hudson Bay area breeding at intervals of two years is common. (B406.37.w37)

+ In the 1970s and early 1980s, studies in Hudson Bay indicated that a two-year interval between litters, with cubs weaned at 1.3 years of age, was common. Later studies found breeding every three years to be more common. Females which lose their cubs may then breed. (B490.27.w27)

+ The interbirth interval is usually three years, if cubs are successfully raised to weaning. (J30.64.w1, `r citep("Ramsay_1986")`)

+ A study in the Hudson Bay area, Canada, 1980-1985, found that the mean time between successive litters was 2.9 years, with 40% having a two-year interbirth interval. Rate of litter production tended to increase with age. (J46.214.w2, `r citep("Ramsay_1988")`)

+ Polar bears generally have a three-year interbirth interval. In Western Hudson Bay, a two-year interval, with litters weaned at 1.3 years, was common, but more recently a three-year interval has been noted, with few yearlings independent at 18-20 months. (J343.52.w3, `r citep("Stirling_1999")`)

+ In western Hudson Bay, the interbirth interval has increased from an average of 2.1 years to 2.9 years. (J30.73.w2, `r citep("Derocher_1995")`))

+ Litters at intervals of two years are now uncommon anywhere in the polar bear's range. (V.w100)

+ Females which lose their cubs before or during the breeding season may come into oestrus and breed. (J30.64.w1, `r citep("Ramsay_1986")`))

#### Sexual Maturity ([link](http://wildpro.twycrosszoo.org/S/0MCarnivor/ursidae/ursus/Ursus_maritimus/07ursus_maritimuslifephys.htm#Sexual))

> SUMMARY: Females may be seen pairing at 3.5 years in some areas, with first cubs born when the female is four, but usually the first mating is at four to seven years, with the first litter born when the female is five to eight. Males may be sexually mature in terms of sperm production by three years of age, but are unlikely to compete successfully for a female, and therefore to actually breed, before six years old.

+ In the fourth year. (B144)

+ Average about 5-6 years. (B147)

+ Females may be seen pairing with males from about 3.5 years. (D244)

+ Females first reproduce at four to eight years, but on average first cubs are produced at six to seven years.

+ In the Beaufort Sea, first breeding age averages five to six years, with first cubs therefore at six to seven years, but individuals may first breed as young as four years or as late as eight years old. (D244)

+ In the eastern Canadian Arctic, the age of first breeding is four years. (D244)

+ A study in the Hudson Bay area, Canada, 1980-1985, found that no three-year olds were accompanied by cubs and only 5% of four-year-olds were accompanied by cubs in summer or autumn, compared with nearly 50% of bears five years old or older being accompanied by cubs. (J46.214.w2, Ramsay1988)

+ Females first mate at four or five years old. (B285.w4)

+ In females, first mating occurs at four years with litters born when the females are just five years old; in some areas (Alaska, western Canadian Arctic), usually a year later. Maximum fecundity is from 10-19 years. (B406.37.w37)

+ In many areas of Canada, polar bears first mate at 4.5 and produce their first cubs when they are five years old, but in some areas first mating is a year later. The sparse data available indicates that females may become reproductively senescent after about 20 years of age, although one female was apparently in oestrus (travelling with a male, vulva turgid) at 29 years of age. (B490.27.w27)

+ While litter size and weight declines in females older than 14-16 years of age, some females still have cubs to at least 27 years of age, although with smaller litter sizes, and in captivity reproduction to at least 37 years has been reported. (J46.234.w1, `r citep("Derocherand_1994")`)

+ First mating occurs when females are four to seven years old in the wild. (V.w100)

+ Males may have sperm present in the epididymis from three years to 19 years of age; it is unlikely that males mate at earlier than six years of age. (D244)

+ Males may be sexually mature at three years old but are unlikely to compete successfully for a female, and therefore to actually breed, before six years old; they may be able to breed to about 19 years old. (B406.37.w37)

+ Males may be capable of spermatogenesis as early as three years of age and to at least 19 years old, with abundant sperm in bears five years old and older. Males as young as three years old have been seen consorting with females, at least in a period when excessive hunting had reduced the numbers of older males. More typically, males three or four years of age, which would weigh less than 250 kg, would not be able to compete for females against older males weighing 400-500 kg or more. (B490.27.w27)

+ A male polar bear in a zoo successfully mated with an *Ursus arctos* - Brown bear at 64 months old (cubs born when both bears were 72 months old.) (J23.9.w1)

#### Longevity / Mortality ([link](http://wildpro.twycrosszoo.org/S/0MCarnivor/ursidae/ursus/Ursus_maritimus/07ursus_maritimuslifephys.htm#Longevity))

> SUMMARY: Maximum longevity has been suggested at 20 - 25 years, or 25 - 30 years, and 45 years has been reported for a zoo bear. Annual pre-weaning mortality of cubs is about 10 - 30%; annual mortality rates for adults are 8 to 16 % and for younger animals may be 20%. A critical time is when the cubs first become independent. It is common for at least one member of large litters (three cubs) not to survive to weaning. Mortality is due to starvation, intraspecific predation and accidents. Starvation is the most important cause of death, particularly for inexperienced and physically disabled bears when seal numbers drop suddenly.

+ The sex ratio at birth is even. (D244)

+ Maximum longevity is suggested to be 20 - 25 years, or 25 - 30 years. (D244)

+ Potential longevity in the wild is about 25 - 30 years. (B147)

+ 34 years seven months in captivity. (B39.w8)

+ A female in a zoo was still alive at 45 years of age. (B147)

+ Based on studbook data, the average longevity in zoos is 18 years, and the oldest recorded individual was 41 years old. (D315.3.w3)

+ In the wild, one individual of 31 years of age and another of 33 years have been recorded. (D315.3.w3)

+ Longevity of females is mid-20s to early-30s, males early-20s, occasionally late-20s. (B285.w4)

+ A hybrid with *Ursus arctos middendorffi* (*Ursus arctos* - Brown bear) lived to 38 years one month. (B39.w8)

+ Preweaning mortality of cubs is about 10 - 30%. (D244)

+ A study in western Hudson Bay found that cub-of-the-year survival between spring and autumn varied annually, averaging 53.2% and varying from 39.0 to 100.0%, with whole-litter loss between spring and autumn of 30.8%; only 38.0% of females did not lose any cubs. Minimum cub survival from one autumn to the next was 34.7%; this was related to cub mass, maternal mass, and maternal condition; it was estimated that cub survival during autumn was 83.0%. Survival for the whole of the first year of life was no more than 44%. (J30.74.w1, `r citep("Derocher_1996")`)

+ In Svalbard, for the period 1972-1980, calculated survivorship for cubs during the period three to 20 months of age was 0.48. Suggested reasons for low survival included cannibalism by abundant large males, and unfavourable ice conditions. (J40.49.w3, `r citep("Larsen_1985")`)

+ In Svalbard, unpublished data indicated an annual adult survival rate of 0.91 for the period after 1977.(J40.49.w3, `r citep("Larsen_1985")`)

+ Mortality is due to starvation, intraspecific predation and accidents. (B406.37.w37)

   + Starvation is probably the commonest cause of death and occurs when seal numbers change suddenly. Those most likely to starve are inexperienced bears and those with a physical disability. (B406.37.w37)
   
   + Causes of death of cubs include predation by adult males and accidents. (B406.37.w37)
   
   + Mortality of members of large litters is common; usually in triplets one is smaller and trails the others. The number of litters of triplets in a given area is higher in spring than it is by autumn. (B406.37.w37)

+ Polar bears sometimes kill one another in fights over mates, and sometimes predate one another. Male polar bears will kill cubs and sometimes, but not always, eat them. The reasons for this behaviour are not fully understood. (B490.27.w27)

+ Bears with serious jaw injuries due to fights or failed predation attempts are unlikely to survive long-term as their ability to catch prey will be seriously reduced. (B490.27.w27)

+ Unusual causes of death reported in wild polar bears include gastric dilatation and volvulus and gall stones occluding the bile duct. (B490.27.w27)

+ A study along the western coast of Hudson Bay, Canada, and around the Churchill dump, 1981-1983, found on bear dead with two pieces of lead batteries in its stomach; the bear was thought to have poisoned itself. (J30.63.w2, `r citep("Lunn_1985")`)

+ Every year some bears are destroyed as "problem bears" around Churchill. (J30.63.w2, `r citep("Lunn_1985")`)

+ A female and her cubs died when their den collapsed. (J343.44.w1, `r citep("Clarkson_1991")`)

+ Subadults 2-5 years old have lower survival rates than do adults. (B490.27.w27)

+ Subadults which have left their mother but not learned to hunt effectively may starve to death. Old bears which become too feeble to catch food also would starve and die from old age. (B490.27.w27)

+ Annual mortality rates for adults are 8 -16 %. For younger animals (cubs to subadults) mortality rates may be 20%. (B406.37.w37)

   + The time when cubs first become independent from their mother is a critical time for survival. (B406.37.w37)
   

+ Annual mortality rate of subadults has been estimated at 3 - 16%. (D244)

+ One adult annual mortality rate estimate was 8 - 16%; typically it is assumed to be 8 - 12%. (D244)

+ The natality rate of females is reduced after about 20 years of age. (B147)

+ Females may remain reproductively active to e.g. 21 years of age, but are in peak reproductive condition at 10 - 19 years. (D244)

+ A female in a zoo gave birth at 36 years 11 months old. (B147)

+ Females are reproductively active into old age. (B285.w4)

+ A study in the Hudson Bay area, Canada, 1980-1985, found that while females 20 years old or older still produced cubs, compared with younger females they appeared to have higher levels of cub loss before summer - 12% of females with cubs-of-the-year in spring were at least 20 years old, but only 4% of bears with cubs in summer were this old. (J46.214.w2, `r citep("Ramsay_1988")`)

+ A study of temporal variation in reproduction in western Hudson Bay for the period 1966-1992 found that cub mortality increased from 25.0% in 1980-1984 to 50.9% in 1987-1992. (J30.73.w2, `r citep("Derocher_1995")`)
